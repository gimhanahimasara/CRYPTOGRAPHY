# CRYPTOGRAPHY RESEARCH ASSIGNMENT
This document is an individual assignment for the Introduction to Cyber Security (IE2022) module at the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT).The paper provides a comprehensive survey of cryptography, exploring its historical evolution, foundational principles, and future technological trends.

The assignment is structured into three primary sections:

1. Fundamentals of Cryptography
Definition: It describes cryptography as the interdisciplinary study of algorithms and protocols designed to ensure secure communication by transforming readable plaintext into unreadable ciphertext.

Core Properties: The document highlights the four essential pillars of information security: confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.

Main Categories: It outlines the three major cryptographic systems:

Symmetric Key: Uses a single key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES).

Asymmetric Key: Utilizes a public-private key pair (e.g., RSA).

Hash Functions: One-way "digital fingerprints" used to verify data integrity.

2. Historical Evolution
The paper traces the development of encryption through several eras:

Ancient: Early use of non-standard hieroglyphics in Egypt (1900 BC) and military tools like the Scytale in Greece.

Classical: Simple substitution methods like the Caesar cipher and the more complex Vigenère cipher, once thought to be unbreakable.

Mechanical: The World War II era, featuring the German Enigma machine and the subsequent development of Colossus, the world's first programmable digital computer, to break the Lorenz cipher.

Modern Computational: The formalization of cryptography as a science by Claude Shannon in 1949 and the later development of standardized algorithms like DES and AES.

3. Future Developments
Post-Quantum Cryptography (PQC): Addressing the threat quantum computers pose to current standards like RSA by developing quantum-resistant algorithms (e.g., Lattice-based or Hash-based cryptography).

Privacy-Preserving Technologies:

Homomorphic Encryption: Allows processing of data while it remains encrypted.

Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP): Enables proving a statement is true without revealing the underlying data.

Advanced Paradigms: The integration of Artificial Intelligence for both cryptanalysis and system design, and the use of Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) for provably secure communication.
